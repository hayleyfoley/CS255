# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was about designing a system for a driving school business. The client wanted a system that would let customers schedule driving tests, buy training packages, and take online training programs. It also needed features for administrators to manage appointments, accounts, and system updates.

# What did you do particularly well?
One thing I did well was breaking down the user needs into clear use cases and making sure all the system’s features were included in the diagrams. I also made sure to use proper UML notation to make the diagrams easy to understand.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could revise one part of my work, it would be the organization of the use case diagram. I’d try to make it more visually structured and grouped better so it’s easier to follow.


# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on what the client described, like the ability to register, schedule appointments, and handle training. I turned these needs into specific use cases and actors in the system design. Considering user needs is super important because if the system doesn’t solve the user’s problems, it won’t be useful or successful.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When I design software, I like to start by understanding what the user wants and brainstorming ways to make it work. In the future, I’d use techniques like creating user stories or wireframes to better visualize how the system will function. I’d also get feedback early to make sure the design meets the client’s expectations.
